## Installation

1. Clone repo
2. run `npm install`

A graphic design portfolio site, focusing on clean and minimal design.

Uses HTML, CSS, JS, and Node.js

Still a bit uncomfortable working between javascript and node js, but slowly gaining ground.

Go to localhost:/admin to see a login/authentication page to see client-submitted inquiries, and keep track of if they have been contacted yet or not; delete when done.

Also enjoyed working with some different CSS properties and styles that I haven't gotten to play around with yet.
